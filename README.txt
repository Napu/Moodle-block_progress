The Progress Bar is a time-management tool for students.
It visually shows what activities/resources a student is supposed to interact with in a course.
It is colour coded so students can quickly see what they have and have not completed/viewed.
The teacher selects which pre-existing activities/resources are to be included in the Progress
Bar and when they should be completed/viewed.

To Install
1. Copy the progress directory to the blocks directory of your Moodle instance
2. Visit the notifications page

Once the Progress Bar is installed, you can use it in a course as follows.

1. Turn editing on
2. Create your activities/resources as normal
3. Add the Progress Bar block to your page (http://docs.moodle.org/en/Blocks)
4. Move your Progress Bar block into a prominent position, eg. top-left
5. Click the Configuration icon on the block below the title
6. Set the activities/resources you want shown in the block (choose "Yes")
7. Set the date and time when the activity/resource is expected to be completed/viewed by (some
   activities have deadlines set, if so, that deadline can be used or another can be set in the
   Progress Bar block configuration)
8. Save changes

Hidden items will not appear in the Progress Bar until they are unhidden. This is useful for a
scheduled release of activities.

When the block is displayed and set up, for the manager there will be two buttons; "Add dates" and 
 "Overview of students".
 
 "Add dates": only magers can see it, there you will find a file picker for you to upload a CSV file
 On this CSV file you can upload presential evaluation dates, so that students, non-editing teachers, teachers,
 and managers, can see when and where they have to show themselfs. (The CSV example for uploading is there to download).
 
 "Overview of students": Now there is a button at the bottom left part of the page, where you can download a 
 file, with the sumarry of the quizzes and assigns, that the student has completed or not. This option is available 
 for every role expet for students.
